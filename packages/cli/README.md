# @open-instinct/cli

The `instinct` command. It sets up your agent, runs it on your machine, deploys it to
Maritime, connects your iMessage, and edits who in your life may ask it for what.

Everything the CLI writes lives in one data directory (`$INSTINCT_DATA_DIR`, default
`./.instinct`). The agent server reads the same files, so a change made here applies on
the agent's next message.

## Install

```bash
# inside the monorepo
pnpm install && pnpm -r build
pnpm --filter @open-instinct/cli exec instinct --help

# or link it on your PATH
cd packages/cli && pnpm link --global
instinct --help
```

Node >=22.22.3 and pnpm 10.6.1 are required.

## Environment

| Variable | Used by | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `INSTINCT_DATA_DIR` | all | state directory (default `./.instinct`); `--data-dir` overrides it |
| `INKBOX_ADMIN_API_KEY` | `init`, `invite`, `connect`, `dev --tunnel` | org-wide Inkbox key; provisions identities and webhooks |
| `INKBOX_BASE_URL` | same | Inkbox API base, only for self-hosted Inkbox |
| `MARITIME_API_KEY` | `deploy`, `chat --agent` | `mk_...` key with the `provision` and `deploy` scopes |
| `MARITIME_API_URL`, `MARITIME_APP_URL` | `deploy`, `chat` | control plane and dashboard base URLs (defaults: api.maritime.sh, maritime.sh) |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY` + `OPENAI_BASE_URL` | `dev`, `deploy` | model access, copied into the Maritime agent on deploy |
| `INSTINCT_MARITIME_MODEL` | `deploy --maritime-llm` | model id behind Maritime's metered proxy (default `gpt-5.4`) |
| `COMPOSIO_API_KEY`, `COMPOSIO_TOOLKITS` | `init`, `dev`, `deploy` | Gmail, Calendar and other apps through Composio. `init` turns `apps.enabled` on when either is set; `dev` warns when the key is set but apps are off |
| `LINK_CLIENT_ID`, `LINK_CLIENT_SECRET`, `LINK_REDIRECT_URI`, `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | `deploy`, `payments` | Stripe Link Agent Wallet. `deploy` copies them into the agent when `LINK_CLIENT_ID` is set; `payments connect` uses them to build the authorize URL when no server offers one |
| `BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY` | `dev`, `deploy` | optional web search key |
| `VISUAL`, `EDITOR` | `persona edit` | the editor to open `PERSONA.md` in; without one the path is printed |
| `NO_COLOR` | all | disables ANSI colors |
| `INSTINCT_DEBUG` | all | prints stack traces on unexpected errors |

`instinct init` stores the identity-scoped Inkbox credentials in
`<dataDir>/secrets/inkbox.json` (mode 0600). `dev` and `deploy` read that file, so you
do not need to export `INKBOX_API_KEY` yourself.

## Commands

Every command accepts `--data-dir <dir>` and `--help`.

### `instinct init`

Writes `config.json`. With `INKBOX_ADMIN_API_KEY` set, also provisions the agent's Inkbox
identity with iMessage enabled, mints an identity-scoped API key and a webhook signing
key, saves them to `secrets/inkbox.json`, prints the matching `export` lines, and prints
the connect instructions.

```
instinct init --name <you> [--phone +1...] [--email you@x.com] [--handle <handle>]
              [--model provider/model-id] [--timezone Area/City] [--city "..."]
              [--agent-name "..."] [--phone-number] [--skip-inkbox]
              [--use-existing] [--rotate-signing-key]
              [--apps | --no-apps] [--toolkits gmail,googlecalendar]
```

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--name` | your name (required) |
| `--phone`, `--email` | how the agent recognises you as the owner; repeat `init` to add more |
| `--handle` | the agent's Inkbox handle, for example `maria-instinct`; required to provision. `owner` is reserved |
| `--model` | `provider/model-id`, default `anthropic/claude-fable-5-1` |
| `--timezone`, `--city` | owner profile fields used in prompts and schedules |
| `--agent-name` | display name of the agent (default from core, for example "Maria's Instinct") |
| `--phone-number` | also buy an SMS line for the identity (off by default; iMessage works without it) |
| `--skip-inkbox` | write config only, even when an admin key is present |
| `--use-existing` | explicitly import an existing identity instead of creating a fresh one |
| `--rotate-signing-key` | explicitly replace the identity's webhook signing key; update any other receivers too |
| `--apps`, `--no-apps` | turn Composio apps (`apps.enabled`) on or off. Apps also turn on by themselves when `COMPOSIO_API_KEY` or `COMPOSIO_TOOLKITS` is in the environment |
| `--toolkits` | comma-separated Composio toolkit slugs (default `gmail,googlecalendar,googlecontacts`); setting them turns apps on |
| `--business` | enable full-autonomy business mode; seed Gmail/Google Calendar unless explicit toolkits were supplied; rerunning init preserves enabled mode |

Running `init` again updates the existing config instead of replacing it. If the handle is
already taken, Inkbox assigns a suffixed one and `init` saves that handle in the config.

`config.json` wins over the environment after the first boot, so exporting `COMPOSIO_API_KEY`
later does nothing on its own. Run `init` again (with `--apps` or the key in env) to flip
`apps.enabled`; `dev` prints a warning naming that fix when it sees the key with apps off.

### `instinct connect`

Prints the Inkbox router number, the `connect @handle` text, a tap-to-text link, and
writes the QR code to `<dataDir>/connect-qr.png`. Text that command from your iPhone and
a new iMessage thread from your agent appears.

### `instinct dev`

Runs the agent server in this process. No Docker, no Maritime. Loads `secrets/inkbox.json`
into env, sets `PORT` and `INSTINCT_DATA_DIR`, then imports `boot` and `createHttpServer`
from `@open-instinct/server`.

```
instinct dev [--port 8080] [--host 127.0.0.1] [--tunnel] [--quiet]
```

The management listener binds to loopback by default. The public tunnel forwards to a
separate webhook-only listener, so it does not expose chat, status or schedules.

`--tunnel` sets `INSTINCT_TUNNEL=1`, opens an Inkbox tunnel to this listener and, with
`INKBOX_ADMIN_API_KEY`, subscribes the webhook to `<publicUrl>/webhooks/inkbox`. Without an
admin key it prints the URL for you to subscribe by hand. Ctrl-C closes the tunnel, the
server and the agent cleanly. `--data-dir` may come before or after `dev`; the binary stays
up either way.

If `COMPOSIO_API_KEY` is set but `config.json` has `apps.enabled: false`, `dev` warns and
names the fix (`instinct init --name <you> --apps`) instead of booting without app tools.


### `instinct business`

`status`, `tasks`, `task <id>`, `pause`, `resume`, `stop [id]` and `close <id>`
use the same durable owner service as authenticated text and the workspace. Local
calls require `INSTINCT_CHAT_TOKEN`, even on loopback; `--url` requires HTTPS except
explicit loopback HTTP. `--agent <id>` authenticates to Maritime with
`MARITIME_API_KEY`, but that relay must also satisfy the controller's bearer check.
If it cannot forward the owner token, use `--url https://<owner-origin>` instead;
never disable the controller token. Global stop persists across restart, does not
undo accepted external operations and never authorizes replay of unknown effects.

Recovery is an offline operator command, never a worker tool:

```bash
instinct business backup --destination /private/backups --retention 7
instinct business export --destination /private/exports/business.json
instinct business restore --source /private/backups/<snapshot-id> --destination /private/restored-business
instinct business delete --confirm-workspace <workspace-uuid>
```

Stop the controller process first. `--business-dir` selects the configured business
directory for backup/export/delete; otherwise the command reads configuration and
defaults to `<dataDir>/business`. Restore targets a business directory, not the whole
personal data directory. It refuses running/unstopped destinations, retains any
replaced stopped directory, and always installs stopped, blocked work for investigation.
Backup retention is an explicit snapshot count, not a time or erasure guarantee.
Deletion requires durable stop and all provider disconnect/revocation requests.
Backups, provider data and hosted browser sessions remain separate. See
[operational recovery](../../docs/SELF-HOST.md#business-owner-operation).

### `instinct chat`

Sends one message and prints deferred `pending` replies in server order before the
current reply, for both local and Maritime transports. A pending-only response is
shown rather than discarded; a current error is still reported.

```
instinct chat "<message>" [--url http://127.0.0.1:8080] [--agent <maritimeAgentId>] [--conversation <id>]
```

Without `--agent` it posts to the local server's `/chat`. With `--agent` it goes through
`POST https://api.maritime.sh/api/agents/<id>/chat` with `MARITIME_API_KEY`, which wakes a
sleeping agent. `--conversation` keeps several messages in one thread. When
`INSTINCT_CHAT_TOKEN` is set, local calls send it as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

### `instinct status`

```
instinct status [--url http://127.0.0.1:8080]
```

Fetches `GET /` (falls back to `/health`), sending `INSTINCT_CHAT_TOKEN` when set, and prints a flattened key/value table: agent
name, owner, model, computer kind, connected apps, conversation counts, uptime.

### `instinct deploy`

Creates one Maritime agent for you from a built image. The request body is the same one
the gateway uses for multi-user signups, so both shapes produce the same kind of agent:
`framework: "custom"`, `exposedPort: 18789`, `healthCheckPath: "/health"`, `desktop: true`,
`externalId: "open-instinct:<handle>"`. Maritime injects `PORT=18789` for custom images; the
body sends the same number as `exposedPort` and as an explicit `PORT` env var so the port the
server binds and the port Maritime forwards to are always the same. Local runs
(`deploy/Dockerfile.agent`, `docker compose`) keep `PORT=8080`.

```
instinct deploy --image ghcr.io/<you>/open-instinct-agent:<tag> [--name instinct-<handle>]
                [--idle 900] [--no-desktop] [--maritime-llm] [--model <id>] [--dry-run]
```

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--image` | the agent image (required); build it from `deploy/Dockerfile.agent` |
| `--name` | Maritime agent name, default `instinct-<handle>` |
| `--idle` | seconds of silence before the microVM sleeps, default 900 |
| `--no-desktop` | skip the Linux desktop (no computer use, cheaper) |
| `--maritime-llm` | no model key of your own: sets `useMaritimeLlm: true` so Maritime injects `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_BASE_URL` for its metered proxy, and sets `INSTINCT_MODEL=openai-compatible/<model>` so the agent uses them. Your own `OPENAI_*` are not copied in this mode |
| `--model` | with `--maritime-llm`, the proxy model id (default `gpt-5.4`, or `INSTINCT_MARITIME_MODEL`); otherwise overrides `config.model.primary` for this agent |
| `--dry-run` | print the body with secrets redacted, create nothing |

Env vars copied into the agent: `PORT`, `INSTINCT_*` owner and model settings, `INKBOX_*` from
`secrets/inkbox.json`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_*`, `COMPOSIO_*`, `BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY`,
and, when `LINK_CLIENT_ID` is set, `LINK_CLIENT_ID`, `LINK_CLIENT_SECRET`, `LINK_REDIRECT_URI`
and `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` for Stripe Link payments. Secrets are flagged `isSecret: true` so
Maritime encrypts them. The new agent id is saved to `<dataDir>/maritime.json` and the command
prints the dashboard URL plus the two ways to receive webhooks: run the gateway, or self-host
with `instinct dev --tunnel`. Creating an agent debits your Maritime wallet; a 402 is shown
with the server's own explanation.

### `instinct invite`

Adds a person to the trusted network and, with `INKBOX_ADMIN_API_KEY`, creates an Inkbox
A2A invitation their agent can accept.

```
instinct invite <name> --tier <partner|family|friend|contact|stranger>
                [--email x@y] [--phone +1...] [--handle <peer-handle>] [--note "..."]
```

`--handle` records the peer agent's Inkbox handle on the contact and opens our side of the
A2A contact rule, so the peer's first task is admitted. The printed link or handoff prompt
is what you forward to the other person.

### `instinct trust`

```
instinct trust list
instinct trust set <contact> <tier>
instinct trust grant <contact> <cap,cap> [--until YYYY-MM-DD] [--max-usd N] [--purpose "..."] [--note "..."]
instinct trust revoke <grantId>
```

`<contact>` is a contact id (`sam-lee`) or a name. `set` creates the contact when it does
not exist. `grant` writes a scoped, time-boxed exception to `policy.json`; `--until` with a
date means end of that day (UTC). Capabilities are the strings from
`docs/PERMISSIONS.md`, for example `calendar.write,plans.commit`. Nobody can be set to
`owner`.

### `instinct payments`

```
instinct payments connect [--url http://127.0.0.1:8080]
instinct payments status  [--url http://127.0.0.1:8080]
```

`connect` prints the Stripe Link authorize URL that links your Link wallet to the agent.
It asks the running server for `GET /oauth/link/start` first (the server holds the PKCE
verifier and finishes the token exchange when Link redirects back). When the server has no
such route, the URL is built from `LINK_CLIENT_ID` and `LINK_REDIRECT_URI`
(`https://login.link.com/auth`, scope `payment_methods.agentic`) with a warning that the
exchange still needs a server. Behind the gateway, the redirect lands on
`<gateway>/oauth/link/callback/<userId>` and the gateway relays the code to your agent.

`status` prints what the server reports on `GET /payments/status` (or the `payments` field
of `GET /`) and whether `LINK_CLIENT_ID`, `LINK_CLIENT_SECRET`, `LINK_REDIRECT_URI` and
`STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` are set locally. Values are never printed, only `set` or `missing`.

### `instinct persona`

```
instinct persona show
instinct persona edit
instinct persona set "<text>"
instinct persona reset
instinct persona path
```

`PERSONA.md` in the data directory is the identity section of the agent's system prompt:
its voice, texting style and what it never does. The first boot writes the built-in default
(or `INSTINCT_PERSONA` from the environment); after that the file is yours. `show` prints
what is in effect, the default included when no file exists yet. `edit` opens the file in
`$VISUAL` or `$EDITOR` and writes the default first when there is nothing to edit; with no
editor set it prints the path. `set` replaces the file with the text given. `reset` puts
the default back. The server reads the file on every message, so a change applies to the
next reply. The agent's name is `agent.name` in `config.json`: `instinct init --name <you>
--agent-name "Pip"`. [docs/CUSTOMIZE.md](../../docs/CUSTOMIZE.md) covers the other layers
(`AGENTS.md`, skills, memory, policy).

### `instinct prompt`

```
instinct prompt [--channel imessage|sms|email|a2a|chat|scheduled|system] [--layers] [--json] [--no-skills]
```

Prints the system prompt your own conversation would get right now, built from the data
directory with you as the owner: `config.json`, `PERSONA.md`, `AGENTS.md`, the memory
digest, your capabilities from `policy.json`, pending approvals and the skills index. No
server or model key is needed. `--layers` prints one row per section (id, length, the file
that decides it) instead of the text; `--json` prints the sections as data. The skills
index comes from `$INSTINCT_SKILLS_DIR` or `<repo>/skills`; `--no-skills` leaves it out.
A running agent adds the tool groups it wired (messaging, computer, apps) and the network
guidance for whoever it is talking to; the text of every file is the same.

### `instinct schedules`

```
instinct schedules list
instinct schedules add "<cron>" "<prompt>" [--tz Area/City] [--name "..."]
instinct schedules add --at <iso-timestamp> "<prompt>"
instinct schedules remove <id>
```

Cron has five fields (`minute hour day month weekday`) with `*`, lists, ranges and steps,
evaluated in `--tz` (default: your system timezone). The server serves these on
`GET /schedules` so Maritime wakes the agent on time; the result is delivered to you over
iMessage.

## Programmatic use

```ts
import { runCli } from "@open-instinct/cli";

const code = await runCli(["trust", "list"], { INSTINCT_DATA_DIR: "/tmp/agent" }, {
  stdout: (t) => process.stdout.write(t),
  stderr: (t) => process.stderr.write(t),
});
```

`runCli(argv, env, io)` returns the exit code (0 ok, 1 error, 2 usage). `io` can also
carry `fetchImpl`, `createProvisioner`, `importServer`, `connectTunnel` and
`installSignalHandlers` so tests never touch the network or the signal table.

## Files the CLI writes

```
<dataDir>/config.json            owner, agent, model (init)
<dataDir>/contacts.json          people and tiers (invite, trust set)
<dataDir>/policy.json            grants and spend policy (trust grant/revoke)
<dataDir>/schedules.json         proactive jobs (schedules)
<dataDir>/PERSONA.md             the agent's voice (persona set/edit/reset)
<dataDir>/secrets/inkbox.json    identity key, signing key, handle (init; 0600)
<dataDir>/maritime.json          the deployed agent id (deploy)
<dataDir>/connect-qr.png         QR for the connect text (connect)
```

## Development

```bash
pnpm --filter @open-instinct/cli test        # vitest; resolves sibling packages from source
pnpm --filter @open-instinct/cli typecheck   # needs sibling dist (pnpm -r build first)
pnpm --filter @open-instinct/cli dev         # tsx src/bin.ts dev
```
